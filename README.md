# GoogleCRSGroup1
In the early 1990s, Francesco Cirillo, a developer and entrepreneur, developed a technique to track his 25-minute intervals of work. He used a tomato-shaped timer that named the technique of ‘Pomodoro’ meaning tomato. This study/work technique is now used by millions worldwide as an effective way to manage time. 
The inspiration for this project came from being engineers and knowing how crucial studying is to becoming a successful college student. However, studying is always easier said than done and sometimes being able to study in a group is not an option. Therefore, with the assistance of the google aiy vision kit, the pomodoro technique is lifted to greater heights to improve the user study experience, manage time, and help hold the user accountable. 
In this project, the study period will begin with the vision kit using facial recognition to detect the user. The pomodoro interval will begin for 25 minutes and will keep the suer’s attention focused on the task. If the users face cannot be detected the vision kit will prompt the user to return to studying and flash red. If a phone is detected, the kit will prompt that a phone is detected and to return to the user’s studies. Once period is over the user will be given a congratulations along with a tone to show completion but will also give a summary of how the user’s time was spent.
